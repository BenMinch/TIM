# TIM - Taxon Interaction Mapper
The Taxon Interaction Mapper (TIM) maps interactions between organisms onto a phylogenetic tree of a target group of organisms.<br />
Interactions are predicted from a species co-occurence-based network (such as one generated by FlashWeave or SparCC).<br />
TIM assumes that evolutionarily related organisms (refer to as ```query```) infect evolutionary related organisms (```subject```)
TIM was developed and applied to infer host group of marine eukaryotic viruses (see references).<br />

## Prerequisites
* [ETE3 v3](http://etetoolkit.org/download/) 
* [Python 2.7.11 or greater](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

## Input files
* A phylogenetic tree for the ```query``` <br /> 
* A table file containing connection between ```query``` and ```subject``` with follwing tab separated columns: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Query ID (same as leaves's names in the tree) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject ID <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Direction of connections (typically the weight, positive or neagtive, in a co-occurence-based network) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;P-value (facultative can be NA if you pre-filtred the connections) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Genealogy of the subject ID (ideally in NCBI taxonomy terms, if a taxomic name is not found the tool will report it) <br />

### Example of input files: <br />
```Picornavirales_TaraOcean.nwk``` a phylogenetic tree for Picornavirales viruses containing Tare Ocean and reference sequences <br />
```connections.txt```FlashWeave Inferred association between Picornavirales and Eukaryotes<br />

## Usage
TIM runs in two main steps scripts: <br />
```main.py tree.nwk connections.tsv [ALL, POS, NEG]``` <br />
```downstream.py``` <br />

## Output files
Results are in the directory myTIMrun <br />
For ```main.py```:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;allNodesCounts.txt: This is the main result file. It contains counts of connections for a given ```subject``` organism group and ```query``` at a given node of the tree. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;taxaNotInNCBI.txt : list taxa's name in your connection file that were not found in the NCBI taxonomy <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;NODES contains details per viristed node
For ```downstream.py```:  <br />
In myTIMrun/downstream: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The two following files belwo can be use to visualize TIM results on ITOL:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIECHART_ITOL.txt: node with enriched connections towards a group of organism (Q<0.05 by default)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treeWithNodeID_forItolPlot.nwk: the tree you input with node ID added.

## List of reference and script files
### Scripts
| Filename | Description |
| ---- | :--- |
|```main.py```|report number of connection for a taxonomic group wiht leaves in the tree|
|```downstream.py```|filters out the output of ```main.py``` and prepare ITOL formated files for visualization|
|```filt_form.R```|used by ```downstream.py``` for filtering and files formating|
|```formatForItolPieChart.py```|format files to plot results on Itol|
|```addFeaturesToTreeNode.py```|add node ID to the tree used by assignHost. Can be use to visualized the results on ITOL|
