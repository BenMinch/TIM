# TIM - Taxon Interaction Mapper
The Taxon Interaction Mapper (TIM) maps taxon interactions onto a phylogenetic tree of a target group of organism using the organism’s associations predicted from a species co-occurence-based network (such as one generated by FlashWeave or SparCC)

It assumes that evolutionarily related organisms or viruses (refer to as ```query```) infect evolutionary related organisms (```subject```)

## Prerequisites

Listed softwares are required by TIM.
Please install these softwares and add their directories to the ```PATH``` environment variable or specify them in ```Pipeline.sh```.
* [ETE3 v3](http://etetoolkit.org/download/) 
* [Python 2.7.11 or greater](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

### Inputs files

The TIM pipeline needs two inputs <br />
A phylogenetic tree for the ```query``` <br /> 
A table file containing connection between ```query``` and ```subject``` with follwing tab separated columns:<br />
 Query ID (same as leaves's names in the tree) <br />
 Subject ID <br />
 Direction of connections (typically the weight, positive or neagtive, in a co-occurence-based network) <br />
 P-value (facultative can be NA if you pre-filtred the connections) <br />
 Genealogy of the subject ID (ideally in NCBI taxonomy terms, if a taxomic name is not found the tool will report it) <br />


## Usage
TIM runs in two main steps corresponding to scripts ```run.sh``` and ```run.py```.
* ```-maindir MAIN_DIR``` : Path of main directory, which should at least contain ```Scripts``` directory and ```References``` directory<br>


## List of reference and script files
### Scripts
| Filename | Description |
| ---- | :--- |
|```run.sh```|main script|
|```assignHost.py```|report number of connection for a taxonomic group wiht leaves of a given node in the tree  |
|```rrrr.R```|test for connetion enrichement for a given taxonomic group at a given node in the tree|
|```addFeaturesToTreeNode.py```|add node ID to the tree used by assignHost. Can be use to visualized the results on ITOL|
